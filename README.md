# web-fonts

A collection of freely available fonts for those of us who would rather host them ourselves than use a font repository such as Google Fonts.

I do not own the itellectual property for any of these fonts. I have only converted them to suitable web formats and written CSS definition files. Licensing and copyright files are included where available.
