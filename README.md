# web-fonts

A collection of freely available fonts for those of us who would rather host them ourselves than use a font repository such as Google Fonts. These are fonts that I find myself using often, not all variations of each font is available in this repository.

I do not own the intellectual property to any of these fonts. I have only converted them to suitable web formats and written CSS definition files. Licensing and copyright files are included where available.
